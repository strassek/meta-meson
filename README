This layer contains the metadata necessary to build Meson, a small Linux
distribution designed for use in UAV applications. Project Meson is currently
interested in delivering an indoor advertising blimp, capable of autonomous
operation.

Building meta-meson
------------------

  git clone -b denzil git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
  cd poky
  git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-meson
  git clone git://github.com/strassek/meta-gumstix-bsp
  . ./oe-init-build-env

  # In order to build the dsp accelerated codecs, you will need to manually
  # download the 'ti_cgt_c6000_7.2.7_setup_linux_x86.bin' binary located at
  # 'https://www-a.ti.com/downloads/sds_support/TICodegenerationTools/' and
  # place it in your build directory. You will need to sign up for an account
  # with TI to start the download. Please do this before proceeding.
  mkdir downloads
  cp <path/to/download>/ti_cgt_c6000_7.2.7_setup_linux_x86.bin downloads
  md5sum downloads/ti_cgt_c6000_7.2.7_setup_linux_x86.bin > \
         downloads/ti_cgt_c6000_7.2.7_setup_linux_x86.bin.md5
  sha256sum downloads/ti_cgt_c6000_7.2.7_setup_linux_x86.bin > \
            downloads/ti_cgt_c6000_7.2.7_setup_linux_x86.bin.sha256
  
  # A limitation of the current setup requires you to mirror the tools in a
  # separate directory.
  cp -r downloads mirror

  # Then add the following lines to your local.conf
  SOURCE_MIRROR_URL ?= "file://mirror/"
  INHERIT += "own-mirrors"
  BB_GENERATE_MIRROR_TARBALLS = "1"

  # While you have local.conf open, change the machine and distro variables
  # to overo and meson, respectively. meta-meson requires the use of at least 
  # one commercial license, so be sure to add 'commercial' to your whitelist.
  MACHINE = "overo"
  DISTRO = "meson"
  LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST += "commercial"

  # After you are finished editing local.conf, be sure to add the layer to
  # your bblayers.conf file. For example:
  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /home/strassek/poky/meta \
    /home/strassek/poky/meta-yocto \
    /home/strassek/poky/meta-meson \
    /home/strassek/poky/meta-gumstix-bsp \
    "

  # That should be all the changes you need to make. To start a build run 
  # the following command:
  bitbake meson-image
